## Abstract

This vignette shows how to optimize the parameters of the NicheNet
method, i.e. PageRank parameter and source weights, using sets of
interactions availabe in the **Omnipath** database.

## The NicheNet Method

**NicheNet** (<https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr>) is a method to
predict ligand-target links between interacting cells by combining their
data with prior knowledge on signaling and gene regulatory networks
(Browaeys et al. 2019). **NicheNet** has already been applied to predict
upstream niche signals driving Kupffer cell differentiation (Bonnardel
et al. 2019).

**NicheNet** uses many different publicly available resources to build
a prior knowledge network. Their final integrated network is composed of
three individual networks:

  - A network of ligand-receptor interactions (Inter-cellular)
  - A network of signaling interactions (Intra-cellular)
  - A network of gene regulation (Intra-cellular)

The new version of the **Omnipath** (<http://omnipathdb.org/>) database
contains curated interactions belonging to these three categories. One
can therefore build an integrated network equivalent to the one used in
**NicheNet** by only fetching from the **Omnipath** webserver. This can
significantly ease the integration of different databases, each one of
them storing data in distinct formats and whose interactions show
different levels of reliability.

We therefore here optimize the parameters used in the **NicheNet’s**
algorithm, i.e. PageRank parameters and source weights, using
interactions available in the **Omnipath** database.

``` r
library(OmnipathR)
library(nichenetr)
library(tidyverse)
library(mlrMBO)
library(parallelMap)
```

## Fetching Omnipath interactions and transfoming their format

We first define a function to transform the format of interactions in
the **Omnipath** to the one used in the **NicheNet** method:

``` r
interactionFormatTransf <- function(InputDf, InteractionType){
  
    OutputInt <- tibble(from = character(), to = character(), 
        source = character(), database = character())  
    
    n <- nrow(InputDf)
    sources <- dplyr::pull(InputDf, sources)
    sourceNodes <- dplyr::pull(InputDf, from)
    targetNodes <- dplyr::pull(InputDf, to)
    
    for (i in seq(n)){
        currentSources <- unlist(strsplit(sources[i],";"))
        for (j in seq(length(currentSources))){
            OutputInt <- add_row(OutputInt, 
                from = sourceNodes[i] , 
                to = targetNodes[i],  
                # source = paste(currentSources[j], InteractionType, sep="_"),
                source = currentSources[j],
                database = currentSources[j]) 
        }
    }
    
    return(OutputInt)
}
```

### Generating the Omnipath ligand-receptor network

**Omnipath** possesses a dedicated dataset storing these types of
interactions (*LigrecExtra*). Therefore, we get these interactions:

``` r
## We remove self-interacitons and duplicated records
lr_Interactions_Omnipath <- import_ligrecextra_interactions() %>%
    dplyr::select(source_genesymbol,target_genesymbol,sources) %>%
    dplyr::rename(from=source_genesymbol, to=target_genesymbol) %>% 
    dplyr::filter(from != to) %>% 
    dplyr::distinct()
```

In **NicheNet**, the authors predicted ligand–receptor interactions by
searching in protein–protein interaction databases for interactions
between genes annotated as ligands and receptors (Browaeys et al. 2019).

We can also do something similar using **Omnipath**. The new version of
**Omnipath** also contains protein annotations describing roles in
inter-cellular signaling, e.g. if a protein is a ligand, a receptor, an
extracellular matrix (ECM) component, etc… Thus, we selected proteins
annotated as ligand or receptor and we searched for interactions
between them (with ligands as sources of interactions and receptors as
sources). The process is described in the following code chunks:

``` r
## We import Omnipath Inter cellular annotations
InterCell_Annotations <- import_omnipath_intercell() 

## We filter those proteins which are mainly annotated as receptor or ligand
Ligands_Receptors <- InterCell_Annotations %>%
    dplyr::filter(category %in% c("receptor","ligand"))

## There are also some complexes. We are going to deal with them by including
## each of its individual protein in our list
Ligand_Receptors_class <- character()
Ligand_Receptors_name <- character()
for (i in seq(nrow(Ligands_Receptors))){
    if (Ligands_Receptors$entity_type[i] == "complex"){
        Genescomplex <-unlist(strsplit(gsub("COMPLEX:", "", 
            Ligands_Receptors$genesymbol[i]),"_"))
        class <- rep(Ligands_Receptors$category[i],length(Genescomplex))
        Ligand_Receptors_name <- c(Ligand_Receptors_name,Genescomplex)
        Ligand_Receptors_class <- c(Ligand_Receptors_class,class)
        
    } else {
        Ligand_Receptors_name <- 
            c(Ligand_Receptors_name, Ligands_Receptors$genesymbol[i]) 
        Ligand_Receptors_class <- 
            c(Ligand_Receptors_class, Ligands_Receptors$category[i]) 
    }
}

## We create a vector with all the ligands and another with all the receptors.
Ligand_Receptors_df <- data.frame(GeneSymbol = Ligand_Receptors_name, 
    Class = Ligand_Receptors_class, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
    dplyr::distinct()
AllLigands_vec <- 
    dplyr::filter(Ligand_Receptors_df, Class == "ligand") %>%
    dplyr::pull(GeneSymbol)
AllReceptors_vec <- 
    dplyr::filter(Ligand_Receptors_df, Class == "receptor") %>%
    dplyr::pull(GeneSymbol)

## We next get protein-protein interactions from the different datasets available
## in Omnipath
AllInteractions <- 
    import_post_translational_interactions(exclude = "ligrecextra") %>% 
    dplyr::select(source_genesymbol, target_genesymbol, sources) %>% 
    dplyr::rename(from=source_genesymbol, to=target_genesymbol) %>% 
    dplyr::filter(from != to) %>% 
    dplyr::distinct() 

## I finally match interactions and annotations.
Matching_Interactions_Annotations <- AllInteractions %>%
    dplyr::filter(from %in% AllLigands_vec) %>%
    dplyr::filter(to %in% AllReceptors_vec) %>%
    dplyr::distinct()
```

We now combine these two sources of ligand-receptor interactions and
then transform to the network format required by the **NicheNet**
method:

``` r
## We access to the Omnipath webservice usign the OmnipathR package and we 
## set the number of sources reporting an interactions as its weight 
lr_Network_Omnipath <- 
    bind_rows(lr_Interactions_Omnipath, Matching_Interactions_Annotations) %>%
    dplyr::distinct() %>%
    interactionFormatTransf(InteractionType="LigrecExtra") %>%
    dplyr::distinct() 

## I have to remove self-interactions
lr_Network_Omnipath <- lr_Network_Omnipath %>% 
    dplyr::filter(from != to) 

## I also have to remove interactions going to ligands. See Methods Nichenet 
## paper
ligands <- unique(dplyr::pull(lr_Network_Omnipath, from))
lr_Network_Omnipath <- lr_Network_Omnipath %>% 
    dplyr::filter(!(to %in% ligands))

## There are in addition some records containing not input gene, we remove them
## since they are giving problems with running the model.
lr_Network_Omnipath <- lr_Network_Omnipath %>% 
    dplyr::filter(from != "") %>% 
    dplyr::filter(to != "")
nrow(lr_Network_Omnipath)
## [1] 20460
```

``` r
saveRDS(lr_Network_Omnipath, 
        "OmniNetworks_NNformat/lr_Network_Omnipath.rds")
```

### Generating the Omnipath signaling network

We generate a signaling network using **Omnipath** resources. In
**Omnipath**, we can find different datasets describing protein
interactions (<https://github.com/saezlab/pypath>). We will merge these
datasets to generate a signaling network.

``` r
## Original Omnipath interactions
sig_Network_Omnipath <- 
    interactionFormatTransf(AllInteractions, InteractionType="Signalling") %>%
    dplyr::distinct() 

## I have to remove self-interactions in the signaling network
sig_Network_Omnipath <- sig_Network_Omnipath %>% 
    dplyr::filter(from != to)

## I also have to remove interactions going to ligands. See Methods Nichenet 
## paper
sig_Network_Omnipath <- sig_Network_Omnipath %>% 
    dplyr::filter(!(to %in% ligands))

## There are in addition some records containing not input gene, we remove them
## since they are giving problems with running the model.
sig_Network_Omnipath <- sig_Network_Omnipath %>% 
    dplyr::filter(from != "") %>% 
    dplyr::filter(to != "")


## We also remove signaling interactions that are already in the lig-receptor 
## network. 
sig_Network_Omnipath <- dplyr::anti_join(
  sig_Network_Omnipath, 
  lr_Network_Omnipath, 
  by = c("from" = "from", "to" = "to"))

nrow(sig_Network_Omnipath)
## [1] 137910
```

``` r
saveRDS(sig_Network_Omnipath, 
    "OmniNetworks_NNformat/sig_Network_Omnipath.rds")
```

### Generating the Omnipath gene regulatory network

In this section, we generate a GRN using the **DoRothEA**
regulons which are available through **Omnipath**:

``` r
gr_Interactions_Omnipath <- 
    import_dorothea_interactions(dorothea_levels = c("A","B","C")) %>%  
    dplyr::select(source_genesymbol, target_genesymbol, sources) %>%
    dplyr::rename(from=source_genesymbol, to=target_genesymbol) %>% 
    dplyr::filter(from != to) %>%
    dplyr::distinct()  

gr_Network_Omnipath <- 
    interactionFormatTransf(
        gr_Interactions_Omnipath, 
        InteractionType="Dorothea") %>%
    dplyr::distinct() 
nrow(gr_Network_Omnipath)
## [1] 113897
```

``` r
saveRDS(gr_Network_Omnipath,
    "OmniNetworks_NNformat/gr_Network_Omnipath.rds")
```

## Parameter optimization via mlrMBO

We are going to optimize the NicheNet method, i.e. PageRank parameters and
source weights, based on a collection of experiments where the effect of
a ligand on gene expression was measured. We have to remove the
experiments involving the ligand IFNA1 because it is not present in our
network.

``` r
expression_settings_validation <- 
    readRDS(url("https://zenodo.org/record/3260758/files/expression_settings.rds"))

index <- which(!unlist(lapply(expression_settings_validation, 
    function(x) any(x$from != "IFNA1"))))

expression_settings_validation <- expression_settings_validation[-index]
```

Running the optimization can take quite long depending on the number of
interactions in the network, the number of iterations of the
optimization process and the number cores of your machine). We finally
save the results that would be used in the forthcoming scripts.

``` r
All_sources <- unique(c(lr_Network_Omnipath$source,
    sig_Network_Omnipath$source, gr_Network_Omnipath$source))

my_source_weights_df <- 
     tibble(source = All_sources, weight = rep(1,length(All_sources)))

additional_arguments_topology_correction <- 
    list(source_names = my_source_weights_df$source %>% unique(), 
        algorithm = "PPR", 
        correct_topology = FALSE,
        lr_network = lr_Network_Omnipath, 
        sig_network = sig_Network_Omnipath, 
        gr_network = gr_Network_Omnipath, 
        settings = lapply(expression_settings_validation, 
            convert_expression_settings_evaluation), 
        secondary_targets = FALSE, 
        remove_direct_links = "no", 
        cutoff_method = "quantile")

nr_datasources <- additional_arguments_topology_correction$source_names %>% 
    length()

obj_fun_multi_topology_correction = makeMultiObjectiveFunction(name = "nichenet_optimization",
    description = "data source weight and hyperparameter optimization: expensive black-box function", 
    fn = model_evaluation_optimization, 
    par.set = makeParamSet(
        makeNumericVectorParam("source_weights", len = nr_datasources, 
            lower = 0, upper = 1, tunable = FALSE), 
        makeNumericVectorParam("lr_sig_hub", len = 1, lower = 0, upper = 1, 
            tunable = TRUE),  
        makeNumericVectorParam("gr_hub", len = 1, lower = 0, upper = 1, 
            tunable = TRUE),  
        makeNumericVectorParam("ltf_cutoff", len = 1, lower = 0.9, 
            upper = 0.999, tunable = TRUE),  
        makeNumericVectorParam("damping_factor", len = 1, lower = 0.01, 
            upper = 0.99, tunable =TRUE)), 
    has.simple.signature = FALSE,
    n.objectives = 4, 
    noisy = FALSE,
    minimize = c(FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE))

optimization_results = 
    lapply(1,mlrmbo_optimization, obj_fun = obj_fun_multi_topology_correction, 
           niter = 8, ncores = 8, nstart = 160, 
           additional_arguments = additional_arguments_topology_correction)

saveRDS(optimization_results, "Results/Optimization_results.rds")
```
